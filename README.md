# Edwin (Ed) Bleiler

Strategy and Operations and Product leader who builds data driven systems in Python and SQL. I focus on turning messy information into clean data models, repeatable pipelines, and clear decisions.

## What I work on

### NBA Player Projection System (Python + SQL)

End to end NBA machine learning pipeline that:

- Ingests daily NBA game data with Python and SQL
- Normalizes it into a structured data model
- Engineers features for reliability, volatility, and context
- Trains LightGBM models to project minutes, points, rebounds, and assists
- Runs on an automated schedule using GitHub Actions

**Repo:**

Replace `<your-nba-repo-name>` with the actual repo path. For example:

## How I work

- Define systems and data flows before writing code
- Build pipelines that can be scheduled, monitored, and audited
- Use SQL to keep logic transparent and reviewable
- Use Python for ingestion, feature engineering, and modeling
- Document assumptions and failure modes so others can use the work

This is the same approach I use for Strategy and Operations, Product, and Chief of Staff style roles. Set up the structure. Make the work measurable. Automate the boring parts.
