# Edwin (Ed) Bleiler – Strategy & Operations | Product | Python + SQL Analytics

I’m Edwin Bleiler, a Strategy and Operations and Product leader who builds data-driven systems that turn messy information into clean data models, repeatable pipelines, and clear decisions. My work blends technical execution in Python and SQL with the structured thinking, prioritization, and delivery approach I’ve used across Strategy & Ops, Product, and Chief of Staff-style roles.

This GitHub profile showcases the analytics, automation, and data engineering work I (Ed Bleiler) build and maintain.

## About Edwin Bleiler

I focus on creating systems that scale — whether that’s a forecasting model, an operational workflow, an ingestion pipeline, or a business process. The same principles guide all my work: define the structure, clarify the metrics, automate what can be automated, and make the logic transparent for others to understand and use.

You’ll see this approach across the projects here on GitHub and in the way I work professionally.

## Featured Project  
### 🏀 NBA Player Projection System (Python + SQL)

This is a full end-to-end NBA machine learning pipeline built by **Edwin Bleiler** using Python and SQL. It:

- Ingests daily NBA game data
- Normalizes it into a structured SQL data model
- Engineers features for reliability, volatility, and context
- Trains LightGBM models for minutes, points, rebounds, and assists
- Runs automatically on GitHub Actions

## How I Work

Whether the problem is analytical or operational, my process is consistent:

- Define the system, inputs, and desired outputs
- Build data flows that can be scheduled, monitored, and audited
- Use SQL for clarity, transparency, and control
- Use Python for ingestion, transformation, and modeling
- Document assumptions and failure modes so work is reusable
- Focus on creating repeatable processes — not one-off analysis

This mirrors the way I’ve worked in Strategy & Ops and Product: set up the structure, make the work measurable, and support decisions with real data.
